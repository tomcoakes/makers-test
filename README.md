Complete the following task in an incremental, test-driven way.

-------------------

You're writing software for a cash dispenser machine.

Assume that machines have an unlimited number of coins & notes in the following denominations:
£50, £20, £10, £5, £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 1p

Write a function breakIntoChange(amount) that takes any non-negative amount in pounds and returns the minimum number of coins and notes representating that amount.

e.g.

```
breakIntoChange(3.45) // £2: 1, £1: 1, 20p: 2, 5p: 1

breakIntoChange(160) // £50: 3, £10: 1

breakIntoChange(0.13) // 10p: 1, 2p: 1, 1p: 1
```
